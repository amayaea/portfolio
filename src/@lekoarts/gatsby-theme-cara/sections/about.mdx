## About

Since a young age I have always possessed an engineering mindset and an interest
in new technologies. I have been fortunate to explore those interests
at Vanderbilt University, where I am an incoming senior majoring in
computer science with a minor in Mathematics. Outside of school, I have also
attended a 3-month coding boot camp at Fullstack School of Code where I have
further focused my skills in web development and worked in teams to successfully
create and deploy various web applications. Looking forward I believe my
time at Vanderbilt and Fullstack will prepare me to be successful in a
software engineering position in an industry that allows me to further
explore my professional and personal interests.
